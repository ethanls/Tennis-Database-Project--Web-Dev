# Tennis Database Project (Web-Dev)
 A project done to understand linking a database to a web application.
 Utilizes JSF, Java, HTML, and SQL. 

 # --------------------DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS--------------------

1. Import the project into NetBeans via your method of choice.
2. Make sure you're using Java 11 and Glassfish (any version of Glassfish should work, I believe version 6 and above work best.)
3. If it's not there when you first import the project, be sure to add the Primefaces dependency to the project (Jar-Jakarta versions.)
4. Install the tennis-23 database using the tennis-23.sql file to your DBMS of choice, we used WAMP and phpMyAdmin.
5. Run the project! There will be a log-in screen when you first open the project. It is more of a proof of concept than anything, it will guide you.
