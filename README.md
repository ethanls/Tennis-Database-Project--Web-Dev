# Tennis Database Project (Web-Dev)
 A project done to understand linking a database to a web application.
 Utilizes JSF, Java, HTML, and SQL. 

 # --------------------DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS--------------------

1. Import the project into NetBeans via your method of choice.
2. Make sure you're using Java 11 and Glassfish (any version of Glassfish should work, I believe version 6 and above work best.)
3. If it's not there when you first import the project, be sure to add the Primefaces dependency to the project (Jar-Jakarta versions.)
4. Install the tennis-23 database using the tennis-23.sql file to your DBMS of choice, we used WAMP and phpMyAdmin.
5. Run the project! There will be a log-in screen when you first open the project. It is more of a proof of concept than anything, it will guide you.

# Possible problems you may run into

* You may get a database error when launching the project. This is because the project's port numbers and methods of signing into the database are meant for windows. You will have to go into the database manager classes and change their port numbers to fit yours. You can find yours in phpMyAdmin.
